# throwback-tuesday
An old project I built at Andover that would juxtapose your senior year photo with your freshman year photo.

Note that this repo originally contained folders from each year, labelled 2010-2015, with every yearbook photo contained within, datamined from the roster PDFs available to students, coupled with student's Andover ID number. For the sake of privacy, these files have been removed in this repo.
